Modify the .env file and enter strong password values for both the ELASTIC_PASSWORD and KIBANA_PASSWORD variables.

You must use the ELASTIC_PASSWORD value for further interactions with the cluster. The KIBANA_PASSWORD value is only used internally when configuring Kibana.

Create and start the three-node Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana instance:

docker-compose up -d
When the deployment has started, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:5601 to access Kibana, where you can load sample data and interact with your cluster.
Stop and remove the deploymentedit
When youâ€™re done experimenting, you can remove the network, containers, and volumes:

docker-compose down -v
